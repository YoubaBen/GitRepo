                    Here at MMU Medical we believe healthcare is a team effort and work in partnership with our staff, to offer our patients a wide range of medical services.  

In an increasingly complex society, we understand the importance of treating patients and staff with respect and dignity. 

Working within local and national guidelines, MMU Medical Practice provides a confidential, relaxed and friendly service.

New patient registrations:

Please be advised, identification is no longer required when registering as a new patient at the practice.

Please ask at Reception for a new patient registration form.

Changes in practice since Covid19:
Every adult in Manchester are being offered a Covid-19 booster jab as part of a plan to fight the rising number of cases and the spread of the new Omicron variant.

All over 18’s can now book their booster jab online using the national booking system. People should not contact their GP practice to book a booster jab. If you cannot book online, call 119.

Manchester residents can also call the Gateway on 0161 247 1334 . Lines are open Monday to Friday, 8am – 6pm. Ask them about a free taxi to and from your vaccination appointment if you need help with transport.

Sites across Manchester are extending their opening times to make it easy and convenient for people to get their life-saving jabs.

You can find details of local walk in sites on the Manchester City Council website.

A face covering is required, where appropriate, when attending the Surgery. You can find out how to make a cloth face covering on Government website: www.gov.uk 

When you book an appointment with your GP you will now have a telephone or online appointment where possible however, if you need to be seen in person, a receptionist will book you into the practice.

Staff in the practice will be wearing Personal Protective Equipment, where appropriate.

The practice will take the necessary steps to make sure that the premises are Covid-19 secure and safe for you to visit.

Hand Sanitizer is provided and 'keep your distance' guidance stickers are located throughout the Surgery.

In line with guidance, we are working on plans to offer:

a booster dose to everyone aged 18 years old and over

a booster dose to people aged 16 years old and over with a severely weakened immune system

booster doses from 3 months after the previous dose - currently it's from 6 months after the previous dose

a 2nd dose to all children aged 12 to 15 years old who are not already eligible

Please note these offers are not yet available. Arrangements are being put in place to get underway as quickly as possible.

The booster vaccine offer will be opened up by age group to ensure the most vulnerable are vaccinated first. The national booking service will initially open up to people in their 40s and older people who would previously have had to wait six months before moving onto younger age groups.

If you are already eligible for your booster you can book by

Visiting www.nhs.uk/coronavirus

Calling 119 or the Gateway on 0800 092 4020 or 0161 947 0770

Visiting one of our walk-in clinics - more information is available at www.manchester.gov.uk/getmyjab

If you need help getting to your vaccination appointment, then the Gateway can help arrange a free taxi to and from the site.

If you were not already eligible, please do not contact us, you will be contacted when it is your turn.

Staff at MMU Medical  thank you for your support and patience in supporting us to help keep you safe in the current, ever-changing, climate.

                    What is Patient Access?<br/>

Patient Access is available to all our patients, helping you to take greater control of your health and well-being by increasing online access to the following:
<br/><br/> 
* Patient Registration<br/>
* Login<br/>
* View all pages<br/>
* View Covid Information<br/><br/>
You have been telling us that you want to be offered more convenience, choice and control in how you access GP services. Increasingly, you also want to be informed and involved in decision about your own care and treatment.

Evidence shows that patients who are informed and involved in their own care have better health outcomes and are less likely to be admitted to hospital.
